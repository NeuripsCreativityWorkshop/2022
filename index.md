## Introduction

Machine co-creativity continues to grow and attract a wider audience to machine learning. Generative models, for example, have enabled new types of media creation across language, images, and music including recent advances such as IMAGEN, Flamingo, and DALL·E2. This one-day workshop will broadly explore topics in the applications of machine learning to creativity and design, which includes:

*State-of-the-art algorithms for the creation of new media*. Machine learning models achieving state-of-the-art in traditional media creation tasks (e.g., image, audio, or video synthesis) that are also being used by the artist community will be showcased.

*Artist accessibility of machine learning models*. Researchers building the next generation of machine learning models for media creation will be challenged in understanding the needs of artists. Human Computer interaction and User Experience communities and those using developing machine learning-based creative tools.

*The social and cultural impact of these new models*. Ethical implications, ranging from the use of biased datasets, replicating artistic work, and potential eroding trust in media content.

*Artistic applications*. Finally, we will hear from some of the artists who are adopting machine learning--including deep learning and reinforcement learning--as part of their own artistic process.  

We will aim to balance addressing the technical issues and challenges of applying the latest Machine Learning models and techniques to creativity and design with the philosophical and cultural issues that surround this area of research.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and artists interested in exploring the intersection of human creativity and machine learning. This workshop solicits viewpoints from artists and technology developers to look beyond technical issues to better understand the needs of artists and creators.
