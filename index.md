## Introduction

Machine co-creativity continues to grow and attract a wider audience to machine learning. Generative models, for example, have enabled new types of media creation across language, images, and music including recent advances such as IMAGEN, Flamingo, and DALL·E2. This one-day workshop will broadly explore topics in the applications of machine learning to creativity and design, which includes:

*State-of-the-art algorithms for the creation of new media*. Machine learning models achieving state-of-the-art in traditional media creation tasks (e.g., image, audio, or video synthesis) that are also being used by the artist community will be showcased.

*Artist accessibility of machine learning models*. Researchers building the next generation of machine learning models for media creation will be challenged in understanding the needs of artists. Human Computer interaction and User Experience communities and those using developing machine learning-based creative tools.

*The social and cultural impact of these new models*. Ethical implications, ranging from the use of biased datasets, replicating artistic work, and potential eroding trust in media content.

*Artistic applications*. Finally, we will hear from some of the artists who are adopting machine learning--including deep learning and reinforcement learning--as part of their own artistic process.  

We will aim to balance addressing the technical issues and challenges of applying the latest Machine Learning models and techniques to creativity and design with the philosophical and cultural issues that surround this area of research.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and artists interested in exploring the intersection of human creativity and machine learning. This workshop solicits viewpoints from artists and technology developers to look beyond technical issues to better understand the needs of artists and creators. 

## Call for Submissions

We invite submissions in the form of papers and/or artwork. Deadline for submissions is Monday 19 Sept 11:59pm (anywhere on earth).

### To Submit a Paper

We invite participants to submit 2-page papers in the [NeurIPS camera-ready format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) (with author names visible), to be submitted to [our CMT portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4CD2022).

Topics may include (but are not limited to):

* Presentation of new machine learning techniques for generating art, music, or other creative outputs using, for instance, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, novelty search and evaluation, etc
* Quantitative or qualitative evaluation of machine learning techniques for creative work and design
* Tools or techniques to improve usability or usefulness of machine learning for creative practitioners
* Descriptions, reflections, or case studies on the use of machine learning in the creation of a new art or design work

We encourage all authors to consider the ethical implications of their work. This can be discussed in a 1-paragraph section at the end of the paper and will not count towards the page limit.

In your submission, you may also indicate whether you would like to present a demo of your work during the workshop (if applicable).

Papers will be reviewed by committee members in a single-blind process, and accepted authors can present at the workshop in the form of a short talk, panel, and/or demo. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Accepted papers will appear on the workshop website. Please note that we do not adhere to a formal peer review process and are normally unable to provide detailed feedback on individual submissions. We encourage submission of work that has been previously published, and work in progress on relevant topics of the workshop. This workshop will not have an official proceedings.

References and any supplementary materials provided do not count as part of the 2-page limit. However, it will be the reviewers’ discretion to read the supplementary materials.


### To Submit Artwork

We welcome submission of artwork that has been created using machine learning (autonomously or with humans). We invite art submissions in any medium, including but not limited to:

* Image
* Video
* Music
* Writing
* Sound
* Dance, Performance, Installation, Physical Object, Food, etc

This year we are asking for submissions to consist of:

* In a text file, include the title, year, artist(s), and description (up to 200 words). Name the text file like: 'project_name_00.txt'.
* One 1080 x 1920 landscape image. Name this image like: 'project_name_01.png'. Both PNG and JPG/JPEG formats are acceptable.
* Optional: Up to 3 additional 1080 x 1920 landscape images. Name these like: 'project_name_03.png', 'project_name_04.png', 'project_name_05.png'.
* Optional: One 1080 x 1920 MP4 landscape video of up to 60 seconds showing the work in more detail. Name this like: 'project_name_03.mp4'.

Place these in a single zip archive called 'project_name.zip'. 
Submit this zip file through [our CMT portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4CD2022).

We will display the accepted art submissions in an online gallery and will do our best to show a number of art pieces as a slideshow during the online workshop itself. We may invite creators of accepted artwork to participate in the form of a short talk, panel, and/or demo.
